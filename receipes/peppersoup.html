<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 Tsp Uziza leaves</li>
    <li>1 pound Goat meat</li>
    <li>2 Tsp Crayfish</li>
    <li>1 Tbs Pepper soup spice</li>
    <li>1 Tsp Red Chili flakes</li>
    <li>1 Tsp Ginger powder</li>
    <li>1 small Onion</li>
    <li>1 Scotch bonnet de-seeded and minced</li>
    <li>1 Seasoning cube</li>
    <li>4 Cups Water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large stockpot, combine the chicken, 2 cups water, 1 tablespoon pepper soup spice, the ground crayfish, 1 lemongrass bundle, a pinch of dry pepper, and the salt. Stir well and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. </li>
    <li>When the liquid has reached a boil, add the remaining 8 cups water and the rest of the pepper soup spice mix. Simmer steadily on medium to medium-low heat until the meat is tender, but not yet falling off the bone, about 30-40 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add the remaining lemongrass and lime leaf, and take off the heat. Let infuse for 5-10 minutes before serving. Taste broth and adjust seasoning dry pepper and salt. Finish with the basil and a drizzle of palm oil, and serve with boiled yam, plantains, or potatoes.</li>
    <em>Pepper soup spice mix</em>
    <li>Toast the spices in a dry skillet on medium- to medium-low heat, stirring frequently until fragrant, about 5-6 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.</li>
    <li>Powder in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle until finely ground. Store in an airtight jar in a cool pantry or the freezer, where it will last for several months.</li>
